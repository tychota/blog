_I'm working on project outside of main office. I mean not far away (around 20
mins walk) but still far enough so I don't eat every lunch at the office._

_For some reason, I was at the office one friday and I took the opportunity to
discuss with one newcommer, let's call him Daniel (name was changed)._

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Hi Daniel. How is going for you this first month? You arrived a bit more than
> a month ago, right?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> I mean that super cool. I learned a lot.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> `I was thinking: let's make it more factual, what does this "super cool" means exactly. Lets use the same framework that I use for my coachees)?`
>
> If you had to put a grade on your feeelig of progression since you arrived?
> Let's say it goes from 0 (no learning at all) to 3 (can't dream to learn more,
> super nice feeling overall).

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> I would say two!

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Two? And why not three?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> I mean... You can alaways learn more.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Tell me more...

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> You know when you code... You end up doing the same thing again and again.
>
> First time you learn, second time, I guess you learn too, then... well then,
> you know how to do the stuff and you stop learning. I mean, it is normal but I
> would like to have every ticket different.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Do you have an exemple of that in your last week?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> _(He thinked for 10 seconds)_
>
> For instance, a button. I did a lot of them, now I know how to do a button.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Interesting example... I'm going to make you realize something that will maybe
> help you... I'm not going to give you the solution directly but make you think
> about it ... through questions.

> So at Toyota, people in the shop floor, they do the same thing, again, again
> and again. For instance, the guy responsible to put the door on a toyota Prius
> do it in 53 secondes. Considering that he works 50 min every hour and 8 hour a
> day, that means doing it more than 450 times a day. Even if that calculus is
> probably too simple, Toyota employees do repetive tasks at a much higher rate
> that us, for sure.
>
> But they consider that they learn a lot. Making people think is part of Toyota
> moto.
>
> But How ?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> I agree, that must be repetitive. Let me think...

`A few exchange later...`

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Hint: What makes Toyota different that other automobile constrtuctors, let say
> Ford?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> Maybe... continuous improvement?

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Exact. When they start there job, they are formed to do 5S, which means in
> simpler terms that they appropriate there workspace everyday a bit more and
> start organising/cleaning it to eliminate waste. They also took part to
> red-buckets analysis, and thus contribute to improve the process and the final
> product.

`(Small break)`

> Comming back to your example... What happen when you click in your button?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> You mean what the effect? It does call an API.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> And when, you click twice quite fast?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> Oh Sâ˜ ðŸŒ©t! That's true.

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> In this case, you have to block button as soon as it is touched once, until
> the request (or an error) come back.

`(Small break)`

> But there is more to learn for button only:
>
> - how to provide native feedback (using so called "haptic feedback")
> - how to indicate loading state into the button
> - what the difference between Material v1, Material v2 and human guidelines in
>   terms of buttons
> - how to provide accessibility in the button, for instance for deaf people
> - ...

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> Indeed that is a lot to know...

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> There is probably a lot more to know. Probably you can make a new
> discovery/good practice about button every day during 6 months.
>
> And then one more year so every single button created at BAM is using your
> good practices. And I think it is a perfect Kaizen; it is simple enough so you
> don't get lost, frequent enough so you have pieces every day and interresant
> enough for BAM so you can easily found a sponsor in the UX team that will you
> push your investigation even further.
>
> What do you think?

<center><code>Daniel</code></center>

> It's inspiring!

<center><code>Me</code></center>

> Thinking like this will make you happier if you eager to learn. There is room
> for learning quite everywhere :)

`Hopefully, he will put 3 out of 3 to the same question if I asked him again in a few month`
